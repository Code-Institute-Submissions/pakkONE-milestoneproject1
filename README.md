## Features
<hr>

### __Existing features__

#### _Logo_
- The logo is a clickable link that will bring you back to index.html (or top of the page).
- User story: After having scrolled through the content of the page, the user would like to find the way back to the top of the page. This is done by clicking the logo.

#### _Navigation Bar_
- The navigation bar is fixed and will follow along on top of the page as you scroll down the content. In this way there will always be a call to action with the user seeing the Get in Touch-button at all times.
- The navigation bar is built by using flex and will therefore work really nicely on smaller screen devices.
- User story: the user has finished looking through the work that Fran has done and would now like to get in touch with her. As the navigation bar is fixed, the user can easily see and click the button that directs the user to the form.

#### _Hero Image_
- The Hero Image gives a visual background of one of Frans handiworks as well as some subtitles that clearly describes what she does.
- User story: the user finds out about the page, browses to the URL and sees a beautiful image with clear description of what the business is about and would want to learn more. The options are then to scroll down along the content or clicking on Gallery or Get in Touch in the navigation bar.

#### _Gallery_
- The gallery is built by using the popular masonry style. The content contains images of things that Fran has personally made, whether it is food arrangement, bridal bouquet or the images containing quotes from known people.
User story: the user browses to the website and would like to see what Fran has done in the past to help make a decision whether the would like to work with her or not.

#### _Get in touch_
- This form is used as a call to action for the visitor and is placed right after the gallery section. By this time hope fully the user will have a hightened interest for Frans services and now we present them with an option to get in touch with her.
- Each line of the form will be required, except the comment section. This is optional and will give the user an opportunity to let Fran know beforehand what the user is interested in as Fran will reach out to the user.
- Once the user has filled out the form and clicks on the Submit button the user will get a confirmation on the page that the form submission was successful.
- User story: the user has seen what Fran is capable of and are now interested in knowing how they can work together or how Fran can help make their upcoming special day/moment even more sepcial.

#### _Footer_
- The footer will contain important copyright information as well as links to social medias to stay in touch with Fran.
- This is important as most of the new content will be posted on her Instagram.
- User story: The user would like to stay in touch with Fran and can at the bottom of the page find links to her social medias (only Instagram for now).

### __Future features__
<hr>

Here are some the future features I will implement at a later stage. This is due to not having enough information at the moment, nor the skills, or that it would be too much time consuming at this stage of the project.

- Use Bootstrap for responsive navbar.
- Change logo to an actual image, the same as Fran has as a profile photo on Instagram (https://instagram.com/momentsbyfran).
- Remake the gallery and use and API from her Instagram so that each new post she makes gets automatically added. (I will also limit it to a maximum of 20 posts)
- Add more links to social media as they are made available.
- Perhaps make three, or more, separate pages as there's more content available. This is to reduce the amount of data that needs to be load each time you go to the webpage.
- Add a blog section where Fran gets to share stories of how moments she made different moments special and perhaps some behind the scenes content as well.
